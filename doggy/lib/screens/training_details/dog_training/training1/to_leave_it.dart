Issuing this command should divert the dogâ€™s attention from whatever has caught his eye, be it furniture or rotted food on the road. The best way to teach your dog the leave it command is to simply use it to get his attention, and then to offer a distraction. You will need to work on this command for some time in different circumstances until your dog realizes that this command means to stop whatever he is doing and to look to you for what he should do next.',
