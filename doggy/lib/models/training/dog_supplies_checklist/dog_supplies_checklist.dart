  Checklist(
      '1. Collar (& leash)',
      'The first act of caring as an owner would be to provide the dog with a proper collar, preferably with the dog name and address clearly depicted on the collar. The collar chosen should be one that is safe and functional to ensure the dog is not undue stress when using it.',

  Checklist(
      '2. Food and water bowls',
      'Providing proper food containers, which the dog identifies as its own, is also important. This will help the animal to identify the food in it, as its own, and therefore be trained not to touch other food items, unless specifically allowed to do so.',
      'images/checklist/bowl.jpg'),
  Checklist(
      '3. An appropriate-sized crate',
      'A crate must be big enough so that he can easily stand up in it and turn around. Your dog should sleep in his crate at night and take naps in it throughout the day. To train him to love his crate, you can make it cozy with a blanket and place treats inside at random times.',

  Checklist(
      '4. Grooming',
      'Grooming tools are also among the items that should be part of the caring kit for the dog. This is especially essential if the breed of the dog requires frequent grooming sessions. Having items such as brushes, nail clippers, shampoos and conditioners are all part of the normal regimen of grooming tools for a dog.',

  Checklist(
      '5. Chew Toy',
      'Chew toys are also items to be included in the list, as these will keep the dog distracted and less likely to resort to destroying the ownerâ€™s things like shoes in the quest to satisfy its natural instinct to chew on anything and everything. It also helps to keep their teeth clean and alleviate any discomfort from teething problems.',
